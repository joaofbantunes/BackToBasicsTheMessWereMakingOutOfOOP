# Back to basics: the mess we're making out of OOP

This repository contains the demo code and slides for my presentation titled "Back to basics: the mess we're making out of OOP".

Feel free to use the issues to ask questions (or suggest improvements). For other ways of contact, you can check out my website at [https://antunes.dev](https://antunes.dev).

## Abstract

Object oriented is (still) the most broadly used programming paradigm. The problem is, most of the times, even though we’re using an OO programming language (or primarily OO, considering languages tend to be multi-paradigm) our code is more procedural than object oriented, not taking advantage of this programming style’s teachings, along with what the languages offer us in this regard.

In this session, I’d like to share some ideas on things we could do to improve our code, making our life easier with more understandable code, taking better advantage of our languages’ capabilities. None of these ideas are new, but it seems as if we just forget them and get back to the same old mess.

## About the demo code

The demo code compiles, but the application doesn't really work, as I didn't implement everything required for it - it would be a good amount of work that wouldn't be relevant in the context of the presentation.

Having said that, I created some extra bits of code that I don't show in the presentation, just in case someone comes check the demo can have some ideas how to implement some extra things (e.g. model binding or JSON converters).

**NOTE:** this code, particularly infrastructure bits I left out or included just as an example, is not production ready. The goal was to have code that would be able to illustrate some ideas. There are some more steps to take to get it to production levels.
